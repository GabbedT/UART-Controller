  ## Configuration Protocol

  ## Main Controller

  ## Receiver

  ## Transmitter

  ## Interrupt
  
  Any interrupt is managed by the **interrupt arbiter**. Since there are three different priority level, the arbiter must ensure that all the high priority interrupt are cleared before the low priority one, no matter the temporal order in which they are generated. 
  
  All the interrupts are generated by other modules (receiver, transmitter and main controller) and the signals must stay high for one clock cycle. After that, the signal are cleared even if the interrupt cause is still there (for example when the receiver FIFO is full, the full signal is high until the buffer isn't full anymore, but in the arbiter the signal arrives in a form of a *pulse*).


  After the pulse is generated, the cause of the interrupt is saved in a FIFO buffer, there are three buffers in the arbiter, each one with a specific priority. Obviously the cause of the interrupt is memorized in the corresponding priority FIFO.

  **Two clock cycle after** the generation of the interrupt, the pin IRQ is set to low to signal that an interrupt has been generated.

  ## Divisor Register (DVR)

  ![DVR](Images/DVR.PNG)

  The Divisor Register is a 16 bit register splitted in two different addressable register (`LDVR` and `UDVR`). Since the divisor is a 16 bit value and two registers can't be addressed at the same time, to read or write the entire value, two different operation must be executed. 
  
  The UART doesn't change it's configuration until two writes on two the two registers happens.

  **LOWER ADDRESS** : 1  
  **UPPER ADDRESS** : 2

<br />

  ## FIFO Status Register (FSR)

  ![FSR](Images/FSR.PNG)

  The FIFO Status Register holds the state of both recever and transmitter FIFOs. Notice how the only useful status flags are: the `full` flag for the transmitter FIFO: the `empty` flag is not really needed because an interrupt will occur when it's empty; the same thing for the `empty` flag for the receiver FIFO: the `full` flag is not really needed because an interrupt will occur when it's full. 

  If the programmer wants the device to interrupt when it receives a fixed amount of data, he can set a threshold for the receiver FIFO buffer.

  **ADDRESS** : 3

  ### Fields Description

  | Field  | Access Mode | Description |
  | ------ | ----------- | ----------- |
  | TXF    | `(R)`       | Transmitter FIFO `full` flag.
  | RXE    | `(R)`       | Receiver FIFO `empty` flag.
  | RX THRESHOLD | `(R/W)` | Forces the UART to interrupt when it receives an amount of data that equals that number. Any value between `RX_FIFO_SIZE` and `0` can be set (**those two values are illegal**).


<br />

  ## Control Register (CTR)

  ![CTR](Images/CTR.PNG)

  The Control Register controls the state of the configuration request for both master and slave. A bit can also be set to set the device into standard configuration.

  **ADDRESS** : 4

  ### Fields Description

  | Field  | Access Mode | Description |
  | ------ | ----------- | ----------- |
  | COM    | `(R/W)`     | Communication mode. 
  | ENREQ  | `(R/W)`     | Enable the configuration process. 
  | CDONE  | `(R)`       | The configuration process has ended, this bit **must be polled** during every configuration process (both master and slave).
  | AKREQ  | `(W)`       | Acknowledge the configuration request sended by the master device, the device become slave.
  | STDC   | `(W)`       | Set standard configuration.
  | SREQ   | `(W)`       | Send configuration request, the device in this case become master.

  **COM Field**

  | Value       | Description |
  | ----------- | ----------- |

  | `01`        | Simplex TX only. | 
  | `10`        | Simplex RX only. | 
  | `11`        | Full-Duplex. |

# Operations

  ## Configuration

  ### Enable configuration request

  The programmer can choose between **two configuration modes** by setting or clearing the `ENREQ` bit in the `CTR` register. 
  
  If the bit is setted, then when a configuration parameter is changed (Data Width, Parity Mode or Stop Bits Number), the device respond by sending the new configuration to the other device. Multiple parameters can be changed with a single configuration request by simply accessing the register one single time.

  ### Transmitter Data Stream Mode

  The programmer can enable or disable the **data stream mode** by setting or clearing the `TDSM` bit in the `STR` register.

  If the data stream mode is **disabled**, once the transmission of a packet of data ended, the device will interrupt. If the programmer wants to send a stream of data, interrupting every time a packet is sent would slow the processor. **Data stream mode** can be enabled in this case: the processor will usually write a burst of data into the `TX FIFO`, then continue its task. The UART will transmit all the data until the FIFO will be **empty**, at this point the device will interrupt.

  ### Receiver Data Stream Mode

  The programmer can enable or disable the **data stream mode** by setting or clearing the `RDSM` bit in the `STR` register.
  
  If the data stream mode is not enabled, the device will
  interrupt everytime a new packet is received. If enabled, the device will interrupt when the number of packet received equals the `RX THRESHOLD` value, if the value is set to zero, then the device will interrupt when the FIFO is full.

  ## Transmission

  Data can be sent serially by writing it in the `TXR` register. *Once the transmitter ended its task, the device will interrupt*. Multiple write can occour in the `TXR` while the transmitter is sending data, the data written in this case will be memorized in the `TX FIFO`.

  ## Reception  

  Once received and the device interrupted, the data can be retrieved through the `RXR` register, every time this operation occours, the FIFO will write the next data into the register. This will happen until the FIFO is empty.
